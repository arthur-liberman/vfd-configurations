# [0] 0 = &gpio, 1 = &gpio_ao.
# [1] pin number - https://github.com/openSUSE/kernel/blob/master/include/dt-bindings/gpio/meson-gxl-gpio.h
# [2] Reserved - must be 0. (0xFF in vfd_gpio_stb skips this entry, required for 2-wire protocols)

# On display:
# VCC - 5V  (KVIM2: Pin #2)
# GND - GND (KVIM2: Pin #5)
# SCL - vfd_gpio_clk = GPIODV_25 (I2C_SCK_A - KVIM2: Pin #22)
# SDA - vfd_gpio_dat = GPIODV_24 (I2C_SDA_A - KVIM2: Pin #23)

# < DHHMM > Order of display chars (D=dots, represented by a single char)

# This field is required but is unused.

#display_type:
# * In [] brackets are the bit index from 0 to 7. You can use the 'Programmer' mode in Calculator to generate the hexadecimal value you need for the following fields.
# {0} - Columns = [0:4] * 2. Rows = [5:7] + 1.
# Examples: For a 20x4 display the value should be 0x6A.
#           For a 16x4 display the value should be 0x28.
# {1} - I2C address - Usually 0x27, but depends on the I2C backpack used.
# {2} - Reserved. Should be 0x00.
# {3} - Controller. 0xFE for HD44780.
